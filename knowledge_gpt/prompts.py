Content: Total Depth, 13,941 ft MDRT : 2,940,541.28 m N (UTM) 3,037 ft TVDRT 596,211.72 m E RT Elevation : 102 ft amsl. Water Depth : 205 ft bmsl. Well Status : Injecting/n2I.2 Drilling Operations I.2.1 Summary of Drilling Operations The derrick was skidded from slot AA-11 to AA-09. A 23" motor BHA was made up and the well was spudded at 13:30 hours on August 4, 1996. The 23" hole was drilled from the seabed at 307 ft to 977 ft, sweeping with 50 bbl HI-VIS pills and running Magnetic Single Shot gyro for every stand.

Content: The string was pulled and a more 'aggressive' building assembly was run in hole. However, it was still not possible to build angle. A 62 bbl cement plug was sputted at 9864 ft but it was not possible to kick of on it. A 65 bbl plug was set at 8924 ft and the well was kicked off at 8450 ft.
